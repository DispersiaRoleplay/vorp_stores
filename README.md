# ðŸš€ vorp_stores V2 (Community Edition)

> **This is a community fork of the original `vorp_stores` resource, created for everyone who uses VORP.**  
> I decided to share this version for free with the community because it makes store management **3x easier**.

### ðŸ”‘ Key changes:
- All items are now defined in **one single file**: `stores.lua`.  
- Direct integration with the **database** for flexibility.  
- Extra **safety checks** added for stability.  

With these changes, configuring or customizing any store becomes much faster and simpler.  

ðŸ‘‰ If you prefer the **official version**, use `vorp_stores` from official author - https://github.com/VORPCORE/vorp_stores.  
ðŸ‘‰ If you want a more **customizable & user-friendly version**, use **`vorp_stores V2`**.
